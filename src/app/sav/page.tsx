                <span className="font-medium text-2xl">
                  SAV was founded with the vision of equitable healthcare access
                  for rural communities

                  The lack of medical infrastructure in these regions often
                  turns minor illnesses into life-threatening conditions. SAVâ€™s
                  mobile units bring healthcare directly to the people, reducing
                  dependency on distant hospitals and improving survival rates.
